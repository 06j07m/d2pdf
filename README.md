## About

D2L's built-in PDF viewer is cramped and difficult to use. Here is a 
bookmarklet[^?] that allows you to open the current pdf in a new window.


## Installation

1. Make a new bookmark in your browser's bookmarks/favourites bar
2. Give it a recognizable name in the "Name" fiel, such as "d2pdf"
3. Paste the code from `d2pdf.js` into the "URL" field


## Usage

Navigate to the "Content" tab in D2L (or whatever your school calls D2L). Open
a pdf. Click on the bookmarklet.
